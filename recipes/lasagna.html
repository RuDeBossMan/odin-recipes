    <h1>allrecipes community tips and praise</h1>
    <p>"[This is] actually quite easy to make for someone who has never made lasagna</p><p>before," according to jimbob2229. "I used ricotta instead of cottage cheese and</p>
    <p>added spinach. Everyone loved it, and I will definitely make it again."</p>
    <p>"I didn't have any ground pork in the house, so I omitted that ingredient, but it</p><p>was great with just the beef," says one Allrecipes community member. "The</p>
    <p>sauce came out terrific too, much better than the stuff you find in jars."</p>
    <p>"I made this recipe last night and it turned out fabulous," raves Daniel Steed. "I</p><p> did increase the meats and sauce a little for the slightly larger pan size,</p>
    <p> but everyone loved it. I served it with garlic toast and green beans for a side."</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <li>½ pound ground pork</li>
    <li>½ pound lean ground beef</li>
    <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
    <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil</li>
    <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    <li>⅛ teaspoon white sugar</li>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>1 pound small-curd cottage cheese</li>
    <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>3 large eggs</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    <h1>Directions</h1>

    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat;</p><p>cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook</p>
    <p>until translucent, about 5 minutes.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil,</p><p>salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring</p>
    <p>occasionally, for 30 minutes.</p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.</p><p>Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet</p>
    <p>firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.</p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh</p><p>parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</p>
    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-</p><p>inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to</p>
    <p>cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2</p><p>of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles,</p>
    <p>cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</p>
    <h3>Step 7</h3>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until </p><p>cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</p>
    <h3>Step 8</h3>
    <p>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</p>

    <h1>Tips</h1>
    <p>Feel free to substitute ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese for a more</p><p>traditional cheese filling. You can also add layers of veggies (such as spinach</p>
    <p>and mushrooms) when layering your lasagna.</p>
