<h1>What is reuben sandwich</h1>
<p>A Reuben is a grilled sandwich featuring corned beef on rye bread. The Reuben</p><p>is a menu staple in Jewish-style delicatessens, but it's not technically kosher</p>
<p>because it combines meat and cheese.</p>

<h1>Allrecipe community tips and praise</h1>
<p>"This recipe was so good," says Cheri Lind. "My family loved it and I will</p><p>definitely make it again. It was so easy and quick to make."</p>
<p>"Here's a tip that works for all grilled sandwiches: Instead of butter, spread the</p><p>outside of the bread with a thin layer of mayonnaise," according to Sudie B. "It</p>
<p>makes a lovely, crispy sandwich, and no one will guess you used mayo."</p><p>"These sandwiches were super easy to make," says Mindy Holley Thornton.</p>
<p>"Tasted just as good, if not better, than at a restaurant."</p>
<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<li>8 slices rye bread</li>
<li>½ cup Thousand Island dressing</li>
<li>8 slices Swiss cheese</li>
<li>8 slices deli sliced corned beef</li>
<li>1 cup sauerkraut, drained</li>
<li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
<h1>Directions</h1>
<h3>Step 1</h3>
Preheat a large griddle or skillet over medium heat.
<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>Spread one side of bread slices evenly with Thousand Island dressing. On four</p><p>bread slices, layer one slice Swiss cheese, 2 slices corned beef, 1/4 cup</p>
<p>sauerkraut, and a second slice of Swiss cheese. Top with remaining bread slices,</p><p>dressing-side down. Butter the top of each sandwich.</p>
<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p>Place sandwiches, butter-side down on the preheated griddle; butter the top of</p><p>each sandwich with remaining butter. Grill until both sides are golden brown,</p>
<p>about 5 minutes per side. Serve hot.</p>
