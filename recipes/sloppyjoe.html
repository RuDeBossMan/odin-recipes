<h1>Nicole's top sloppy joe tips</h1>
<p>"There's no need to pull out any of that canned stuff," according to Nicole</p><p>McLaughlin (a.k.a. NicoleMcMom), who says you've already got everything you</p>
<p>need to make a perfect Sloppy Joe sitting in your pantry. Here are a few of her</p><p>favorite Sloppy Joe tips and tricks:</p>
<p><li>Nicole doesn't like to drain the meat after she cooks it (she likes to use the</p><p></p>rendered fat to saute the onions and bell peppers), so she prefers using a lean meat.</li>
<p><li>"When it comes to the bun," Nicole says, "the cheaper the better." For the<p>classic Sloppy Joe experience, you want it to absorb all the excess liquid.</p></li></p>
<p><li>Make sure to overfill the bun so that some meat spills out. Why? So you can<p>scoop it up with potato chips, of course!</p></li></p>
<h1>What to serve with sloppy joes</h1>
<p>Recipe creator Tamara suggests serving these Sloppy Joe sandwiches with</p>homemade sweet potato fries. They also pair well with all kinds of diner-style<p></p>
<p>side dishes! For instance:</p>
<li>Homemade Crispy Seasoned French Fries</li>
<li>Homemade Mac and Cheese</li>
<li>Refrigerator Dill Pickles</li>
<li>Restaurant-Style House Salad</li>
<li>Boston Baked Beans</li>
<h1>Can you make sloppy joes ahead of time?</h1>
<p>Yes, you can make Sloppy Joes ahead of time. Simply follow the recipe</p><p>instructions, let cool, and store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to</p>
<p>three days. Reheat thoroughly on the stove or in the microwave and serve on</p><p>fresh hamburger buns.</p>
<h1>Allrecipes community tips and praise</h1>
<p>"I wanted a Sloppy Joe recipe that was quick and easy, a little sweet, but not</p><p>unbearably sweet," says momof2ingeorgia. "This was AWESOME! I make it once</p>
<p>every 2 weeks. Quick and easy, especially on a day when we have soccer practices!"</p>
<p>"Great balance of flavors and as easy as opening a canned mix," according to</p><p>WithaC. "I've made it exactly as described and also in the Crock-Pot (brown and</p>
<p>drain the beef first). This is now a family favorite."</p>
<p>"Terrific recipe," raves steve22. "Ended up using ground venison instead of beef.</p><p>Couldn't tell the difference. Will definitely make again. Quick and easy."</p>
